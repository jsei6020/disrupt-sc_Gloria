## Core Concepts

### Spatial Agent-Based Modeling

DisruptSC combines two powerful modeling paradigms:

**Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**
:   Economic agents with autonomous behaviors and interactions

**Spatial Modeling**
:   Agents are embedded in geographic space with transport networks

This combination enables realistic simulation of:
- Economic decision-making by individual actors
- Spatial constraints on trade and transport
- Network effects and cascading disruptions
- Geographic heterogeneity in impacts

```

## Agent Types

DisruptSC models three types of economic agents:

### 🏭 [Firms](agents.md#firms)
- **Role**: Producers of goods and services
- **Behavior**: Production planning, supplier selection, inventory management
- **Location**: Spatially distributed based on economic data
- **Key Attributes**: Sector, production capacity, input requirements

### 🏠 [Households](agents.md#households)  
- **Role**: Final consumers of goods and services
- **Behavior**: Consumption demand, retailer selection
- **Location**: Population-weighted spatial distribution
- **Key Attributes**: Region, consumption patterns, size

### 🌍 [Countries](agents.md#countries)
- **Role**: International trade partners
- **Behavior**: Imports and exports goods and services
- **Location**: Border points
- **Key Attributes**: Trade shares

## Network Structures

### [Transport Networks](networks.md#transport-networks)

Multi-modal infrastructure with :

- **Roads** - Primary domestic transport
- **Maritime** - International transport  
- **Railways** - Freight corridors
- **Airways** - High-value goods or distant islands
- **Waterways** - River and canal transport
- **Pipelines** - Oil and gas

### [Supply Chain Networks](networks.md#supply-chain-networks)

Commercial relationships between agents:
- **B2B Links** - Firm-to-firm
- **B2C Links** - Firm-to-household
- **Imports/Exports** - Country-to-firm, country-to-household, firm-to-country
- **Transit** - Country-to-country

## Model Workflow

### Initialization Phase

1. **[Transport Network Setup](networks.md#transport-setup)**
   - Load infrastructure data
   - Build network graph
   - Configure logistics parameters

2. **[Agent Creation](agents.md#agent-creation)**
   - Generate firms from economic data
   - Place households by population
   - Position countries at borders

3. **[Supply Chain Formation](networks.md#supply-chain-formation)**
   - Link buyers and suppliers
   - Assign commercial relationships
   - Configure trade parameters

4. **[Logistic Routes Identification](networks.md#route-optimization)**
   - Find lower-cost transport paths from suppliers to clients
   - Assign transport costs to firms

5. **[Initial Economic Equilibrium](simulation.md#equilibrium)**
   - Calculate production levels
   - Set prices and flows
   - Initialize inventories

### Simulation Phase

1. **[Disruption Scenario](disruptions.md)**
   - Schedule disruption: transport, capital, productivity
   - Trigger disruption and recovery processes

2. **[Dynamic Simulation](simulation.md#time-steps)**

## Performance

### Computational Complexity
- **Shortest path algorithm** is for initial route selection and rerouting is most computationally intensive
- **Scales** with number of agents and number of linkages, linear in simulation duration

### Memory Requirements
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM for small models
- **Recommended**: 16GB+

### Runtime Performance
- **Initialization**: Seconds to minutes, depending on scale
- **Simulation**: Seconds for undisrupted time steps, minutes for disrupted time steps

### How to speed-up
- **Cut off** small agents and commercial relationship
- **Cache** routes and initial states
- **Parallelize**: not yet implemented
